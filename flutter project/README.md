# 🎯 Projectile Pro – Flutter Physics Simulation App

**Projectile Pro** is a Flutter-based educational physics simulator that visually demonstrates the motion of a projectile under gravity.  
It allows users to experiment with different launch speeds and angles and see real-time trajectory, range, height, and time of flight.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧮 **Real-Time Physics Simulation**  
  Uses kinematic equations to simulate projectile motion under constant gravity.

- 🎨 **Smooth Visuals (CustomPainter)**  
  The projectile path, trajectory, and position are animated frame-by-frame.

- ⚙️ **Interactive Controls**  
  - Adjust **speed** (m/s) and **launch angle** (°) using sliders.  
  - **Launch**, **Pause**, and **Reset** simulation dynamically.

- 📊 **Instant Calculations**  
  - **Time of Flight (T)**  
  - **Maximum Height (Hₘₐₓ)**  
  - **Range (R)**

- 🧠 **Physics Principles**  
  Implements standard projectile motion formulas:
